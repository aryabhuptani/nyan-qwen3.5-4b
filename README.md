# nyan-qwen3.5-4b

Experiments steering **Qwen3.5-4B** into cat-like characters with native MLP neurons. The current study composes published neuron interventions with fixed scalar offsets: **no output training, learned adapter, assistant prefill, or persona instruction**. Model weights remain unchanged.

A five-neuron combination produces a coherent “I'm a cat girl! (Meow~)” response to “Who are you?”. That is a selected discovery example: broader catgirl identity has **not** been established. All successful examples, failed combinations, controls, and prompt sets are saved.

- [Public neuron priors and attribution](catgirl/composition/PRIOR_ART.md)
- [Raw native-composition results](catgirl/composition/results/)

The strongest completed generalization result so far is narrower: a two-neuron combination produces both bubbly language and explicit virtual affection on 11/11 applicable held-out cases (including one linked conversation). It frequently replaces the requested task with affectionate chatter. This is evidence about intervention behavior, not proof of a naturally occurring “catgirl circuit” or clean semantic neuron functions.

## Earlier learned activation experiment

The earlier **Mika** experiment optimized gains and biases on **4,096 coordinates using persona response targets**. It is a trained activation intervention, separate from the native-neuron composition study. Its persona persistence results and graphics should not be interpreted as single-neuron discovery.

Historical artifacts: [report](catgirl/REPORT.md), [reproduction](catgirl/REPRODUCE.md), [coefficient CSV](catgirl/candidates/catgirl_v1_coordinates.csv), and [artifact index](catgirl/ARTIFACTS.md). The historical demo is `catgirl/demo.py`; the native demo is `catgirl/composition/demo.py`.

Built on [Lyra's neuron-explorer](https://github.com/lyramakesmusic/neuron-explorer), with neuron intervention priors attributed in the native study. Original tools and documentation follow.

## Original neuron explorer

Steering-first neuron explorer for Qwen3.5-4B. Every MLP neuron in a layer is pushed up and down on a few prompts, every
rollout is kept, and the explorer lays the results out over a 3D view of the model.

## Explorer

    uv sync
    uv run python explorer/server.py        # http://localhost:8791

Reads sweep runs from `runs/` and per-layer stats from `stats/`, both produced by the sweep below; the caches in
`explorer/cache/` ship with the repo. Loads Qwen3.5-4B locally (MPS, CUDA or CPU) for live
steered chat, lens, connections and live inference over your own text.

- **map**: the model's layers in perspective, attention and MLP per layer, one point per neuron. Hover shows a neuron's
  steer lens and logit lens; click opens it; click a layer's label to view its sheet face-on. `writes` places
  neurons with similar down-projection columns next to each other.
- **list**: units ranked by word-cluster mass against random-direction controls; `lens` searches the steer and logit
  lenses for a token, `fires` runs your text through the model and filters neurons by activation.
- **neuron**: steered rollouts per prompt and dose, a three-column multi-turn steered chat (−, 0, +), lens and
  connections, and a name.
- **embeddings**: UMAP of a layer's rollouts, coloured by neuron, prompt, dose or kind.
- **language**: the interface follows the browser language on first visit; the menu at the right of the header
  switches between English and Simplified Chinese (the choice is kept in this browser). Translations live in
  `explorer/static/i18n.js`.
- **Claude** (fourth neuron-panel tab, or the right-edge handle): a chat running the `claude` CLI (installed and
  logged in) with the explorer as an MCP server (`explorer/agent_mcp.py`). It reads neurons, cones and lenses, runs the
  live model (steering, activations, next-token logprobs, ablations), moves the map, list and highlights, and has file
  tools and a shell in your home folder. Its prompt is `explorer/agent_prompt.md` plus `explorer/agent_methodology.md`, and
  `explorer/agent_prompt.local.md` when present (untracked, for your own additions);
  `EXPLORER_CLAUDE_MODEL` picks the model. The server answers only pages and tools on this machine.

## Sweep

Runs on a CUDA 13 GPU pod with the steering fork of vLLM ([RhizoNymph/vllm](https://github.com/RhizoNymph/vllm)).

    bash sweep/setup_pod.sh                                   # fork, deps, model; writes /workspace/env.sh
    python sweep/neuron_stats.py --layers 22 --tokens 2000000 --out stats/q35-4b
    python sweep/steer_sweep.py --stats stats/q35-4b_L22.npz --design main_rel --dose-unit rel \
        --neurons all --random-controls 256 --run q35-4b-L22
    sweep/run_depth.sh "4 9 13 17" 384 64                     # random-subset sweep across several layers

`main_rel` doses are fractions of the median residual norm leaving the layer: {who, snake, orange} × {−0.7, +0.5, +0.8}
and {free} × {+3}, plus one unsteered baseline per prompt.
